I got pictures of you in funny poses
Letters from you with pressed yellow roses
I've got souvenirs of fun times together
And I'll cherish those years
And you can bet I'm forever

I know we'll be lovers again, darling
I know we'll be lovers again
It's a matter of time
'Til you see that I'm
The one in the end
I was your friend
Lovers again

I got pictures of you with stolen kisses
We looked so young and so full of promise
And we had those dreams
But they're not forgotten
'Cause I'll build that house
With the yellow rose garden

I know we'll be lovers again, darling
I know we'll be lovers again
It's a matter of time
'Til you see that I'm
The one in the end
I was your friend
Lovers again

Ooh, oh

There's a picture of you
In yesterday's paper
With that smile I knew
And the new name you've taken
And I'll live each day
Without being bitter
'Cause we weren't that way ('cause we weren't that way)
And I know (and I know)
It's not over

I know we'll be lovers again, darling
I know we'll be lovers again
It's a matter of time
'Til you see that I'm
The one waiting there
And in the end
We'll be lovers again
