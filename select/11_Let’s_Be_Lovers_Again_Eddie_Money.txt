Let's take a day
Let's slip away
Yeah we'll laugh and play
and both pretend that we're lovers again
Do you remember when
I kissed you with the wind
We had our secrets then
I never told no one so let's be lovers again
Please find some time to spend
With a long lost friend
and we'll be lovers again
Yeah we'll be lovers again
I see you now and then
I wonder how you been girl
I don't want to hurt you
I don't want to know him
Let's just be lovers again
I find it so hard now
to live without you baby
I know you want him
and you don't need me
I hear your girlfriends talk about you
But I wanna talk to you again myself
So I can see baby
Yeah, we'll be lovers again
We'll be lovers again
Stop the hands of time
Tell me that you're mine
Come on back to me
Can't you see I need you
We'll be lovers again
